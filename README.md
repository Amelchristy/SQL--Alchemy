# SQL Alchemy Challenge

#Part 1 
This challenge uses Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. All of the following analysis were completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


#Part 2
In the second part, I design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
